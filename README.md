# Projects
This repository contains a collection of small projects developed as part of my learning journey in the field of Analysis and Design of Algorithms. Each project showcases the application of fundamental algorithmic concepts to solve practical problems.

Projects Included:-

Student Management System:-
Implements CRUD operations for managing student records efficiently.
Demonstrates the use of sorting and searching algorithms for data manipulation.

Comparison of Algorithms:-
Benchmarks and compares the performance of different algorithms (e.g., sorting, searching) on datasets of varying sizes.
Provides insights into time and space complexities.

Shortest Distance Calculator:-
Computes the shortest path between nodes in a graph using algorithms like Dijkstra's and Floyd-Warshall.
Explores real-world applications in route optimization and navigation systems.

Features:- 
Practical examples of algorithm design and implementation.
Clear documentation for understanding the approach and logic behind each project.
Code is modular and beginner-friendly, making it easy to learn and adapt.
